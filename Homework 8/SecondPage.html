        Rain poured down from the darkened sky, a percussion of sharp metallic clangs on the taxi's thin roof that meshed uneasily with the choked purr of the engine. 
        The wind whistled by, conducting the otherwise rhythmic tap-tap-tap of the rain into an uneven crescendo as it blew about in the gale. 
Hedgerows peering over the low stone walls confining the gravelly road moved slowly past, barely illuminated by the weak headlights. It was the kind of oppressive yet 
exposed near-darkness that can only be found in the open fields of the countryside. 

They had been travelling in silence for what felt like hours, far away from the lively city lights in Edinburgh. The man in the back seat pulled out a pocketwatch from 
his finely tailored waistcoat for what felt like the umpteenth time, the clear glass face and delicate hands showing that it was nearing 11pm.
He closed the case with an impatient snap, stuffing it away and turning towards the letter on the seat next to him. The seal was broken, the folds of the paper wearing 
through from all the times he'd read it. He smoothed out the creases and held it up to the meagre light inside the cab to read.


<p>My dear friend,</p>

<p>With how well-informed you are you've no doubt heard the rumours, maybe even attended the parties. But we have a great opportunity at our fingertips.
The old man has done the unthinkable, unachieveable. He's succeeded where so many other curiosity-purveyors failed.
But, he's too senile to make good use of it anymore. We should do him a favour, and take the burden of that research off his hands. It's only kind, don't you think?
I know you're no stranger to this kind of work, and I assure you that I would gladly come with, if circumstances permitted me. But I have faith in you, my friend. 
Together this secret will make us rich.</p>
<br />
<p>Much love, mon ami</p>
<p>Pelletier</p>
<p>His eyes glanced up towards the window as the crunching of gravel under the tyres turned into the smooth hum of evenly-laid paving stones, catching a glimpse of a plaque engraved 
with the words "Thornewood Manor". The taxi rounded a corner, the headlights illuminating a wrought-iron gate strangled by ivy, the leaves trembling in the wind.
The driver glanced at his passenger though the rear-view mirror, trying to hide his anxiety with a jovial tone as he opened his mouth to speak for the first time since they left.</p>
<br />
<p>"Nice of them to leave the gate open for ye, saves us having to step out into the rain, ay Aideen?" </p>
<p>"Call me McCloy."</p>
"Ah. Sorry sir, the lads at the office mixed your name around on the ledger. You know how the wee ones are these days, they don't pay much attention to the details..."
<br />
<p>He trailed off, silence once again returning as they drove up the path to a quiet stately <span style="color: blue;">house</span>. It was modest for a manor of it's renown, just the right size for a rich family 
and it's staff, and presumably once held the warmth that all well-loved homes are required to have. But now the well-cut stones were streaked with dirt and slowly merging with the 
weeds on the lawn, the wooden panelling of the upper floors falling away as their supports rotted, and the once shining windows smeared and broken, tattered curtains behind them 
fluttering in the wind like haunted memories of the life it once contained.</p>
<p>The taxi came to a halt, broadside to the shadowed front door.</p>
<p>"Well, here we are Mr. McCloy. That'll be one pound three crowns."</p>
<p>Aideen pulled his wallet from the letterman's satchel, pulling a ten-dollar note from it's folds and tossing it carelessly onto the front seat.</p>
<p>"Keep the change."</p>
<p>Then, pulling sharply on the door handle, he slung the bag over one shoulder and stepped out into the rain.</p>
<br />
<p>The paved tiles were wet and slippery, but he moved with self-assured purpose up to the manor's entrance. The door was engraved with flowers and vines, the carved handle 
resembling a wreath of blooming <span style="color: crimson;">roses</span> an homage to the estate's name, no doubt. He reached out to grasp it, his hand barely brushing the ornate handle before lightning 
snapped across the sky, rolling thunder following swiftly after. He glanced behind him, watching the taxi pull away and back into the night. There would be no going back.
Firmly readjusting his grip on the handle, he pushed open the door and entered the darkness of the manor.</p>
